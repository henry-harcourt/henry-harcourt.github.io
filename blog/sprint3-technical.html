   <h1>Some Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
   <h2>What is the difference between HTML and CSS?</h2>
   <p>One way I like to think of HTML and CSS is like when I watch my partner play the sims. She will first construct the house that she wants to eventually want to put her Sims in; she puts up walls, windows, a roof, and a path to the front door. This is how we can view HTML - the structure. 
    Once the fundamental structure is in place she will then apply some styling to the house. She chooses different colours for the walls, and selects furniture and picture frames for each room. This is similar to the way we use CSS to style an HTML document.</p>
   <h2>What Are Control Flow and Loops?</h2>
   <p>Control flow is the regular order in which a computer will execute programs, from the first file to the last. This can be altered by a software programmer inserting a loop (or a conditional), such as an ‘if else’ statement where the computer will only move onto the next step if a certain condition is met. 
    In ‘human daily life’ terms, this could be compared to a grocery shop excursion. To successfully fulfill the grocery shop you must first write your list, then get in the car, then drive to the supermarket, then enter the supermarket, before finally buying the groceries. If one of these conditions such as ‘entering the supermarket’ was not met, then you would not be able to complete the task, or ‘flow’. 
    When we enter a conditional statement or loop, the computer reads this as a way of making sure conditions are met before moving on, otherwise it will loop them back until the condition is met. i.e. if you do not enter the supermarket, you will not be able to buy the groceries</p>
   <h2>The DOM and How We May Interact With It</h2>
   <p>The DOM, or ‘Document Object Model’ is commonly referred to as the glue between programming languages. It allows the code to communicate and regurgitate what we see on the screen. The DOM is built in a tree structure with each branch containing a node which represents an object or a part of the document.
    These objects can be interacted with and may have event handlers attached to them which indicates to the DOM when certain pathways in the tree may be executed.
    A developer can interact with the DOM by ‘inspecting’ a web page using “ctrl + shift + i” (on windows) which will bring up the developer tools. From here, one may interact with the DOM and edit the appearance as well as the functionality of the page.</p>
   <h2>Accessing Data From Arrays and Objects</h2>
   <p>An Object and an Array are both collections of data values. An object can hold multiple properties and characteristics, whereas an array is just one property that may hold multiple values.</p>

   <p>The data in an object can be accessed, altered or changed using dot and bracket notation such as in the image bellow.</p>

   <p>With an array, we may access and alter the information like so:</p>

   <h2>What Are Functions and Why Are They Useful?</h2>
   <p>A function is a fundamental part of Javascript that gives it its ability to create conditional events and interactivity within a webpage or program. 
    A function is simply a task that is laid out for the computer to perform when it is ‘invoked’ or called upon.
    They are useful because they allow us to put conditional events into our code.</p>
