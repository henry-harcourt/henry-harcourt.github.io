        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
          <h2>What Is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise emotions in oneself and in others. By recognising these emotions and feelings one has a greater understanding of themselves and others and how they might engage in and interact in certain circumstances. 
              Emotional Intelligence is also referred to as “EQ” or “Emotional Quotient”, as compared to “IQ” or “Intelligence Quotient”. 
              Some people have an innately higher EQ than others, although that doesn’t mean that those with lower EQ cannot train themselves in emotional intelligence to raise their EQ. 
            </p>
          <h2>How is Emotional Intelligence Different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence refers to EQ “Emotional Quotient” while IQ refers to “Intelligence Quotient”. IQ states a person’s intellectual abilities as assessed by an IQ test, a standardised test that consists of problems for the test taker to solve, usually using logical analysis and reasoning. 
              EQ is different in that it is more socially focused, and as the name implies, emotionally focused.
            </p>    
          <h2>Why is it Important?</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelligence is an important skill to cultivate because it is about understanding oneself as well as others in an emotional and interpersonal sense. 
              When one has a heightened sense of emotional intelligence they are able to better read a social scenario and how they might personally react to a circumstance, as well as how others may react. 
              Research has indicated that people with a higher EQ are often found in leadership positions, are respected by supportive and sizable social groups, and have a better mental wellbeing.
