    <h2>A Time I was Blocked On A Simple Problem</h2>
      <p>
         A time I got very stuck and very frustrated on a simple problem was when I was trying to apply styling to my blog page. I had a specific idea in mind and I knew the steps I had to take to implement the styling. Once I had finished inputting all the CSS styling I clicked over to my webpage to check that it looked as I had planned only to find that nothing had changed. I spent aaages trying to figure out what the problem was; I changed the classes around, I deleted old classes that I thought were overriding the new ones I’d put in. In the end I decided I’d spent too long trying to fix it so I would just upload the page as is and move onto my next task. 
         When I uploaded the page and published the link to the study group Slack chat, I asked if anyone could possibly offer a second pair of eyes on my code to see if they could figure out what was going on.
         To my embarrassment, as well as relief, someone was able to point out that I had simply misspelled a crucial piece of the code so that it wasn’t being recognised in other parts of the web page. Once I fixed the typo, everything fell into place.

    <h2>A Time I Solved A Problem In An Elegant Way</h2>
      <p>
         While doing the FIzzBuzz challenge I was a little stumped. I had a rough idea of what kind of javascript code I was going to have to use to get the desired results of the tests but I needed a springboard to get me on the right path. I googled (yep - elegantly googled!) some sample code for how to solve the problem and ended up finding a great resource that explained a simple way of solving the problem as well as more complicated variations of coming to the same solution. The resource, a series of blogs on the website Medium, ended up being a good source for further reading as well.

    <h2>Problem Solving Techniques</h2>
      <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
            <p>
                I find this useful but also kind of confusing because I have to think about the code in two languages - english and code. This is obviously very useful because it’s strengthening my understanding of what I’m actually doing.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Something</strong></li>
            <p>
                A good technique. The only drawback is I find that I sometimes leave a messy trail behind me of forgotten broken code!
            </p>
          <li><strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong></li>
            <p>
                Haven’t tried this yet. Seems crazy but people seem to love it!
            </p>
          <li><strong>Reading Error Messages</strong></li>
            <p>
                Error messages are helpful but don’t always make sense to me. At least it’s obvious that something is broken and I can just copy paste the error into google.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Console Logging</strong></li>
            <p>
                Very handy technique to output code directly to the console and see if the code is working correctly.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Googling</strong></li>
            <p>
                My best method for problem solving so far.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Asking Peers For Help</strong></li>
            <p>
                This is probably right up there with google! Both the facilitators and others in the study group have helped me out of a tricky spot more than once.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Asking Coaches For Help</strong></li>
            <p>
                Asking coaches is great, I get my hand held up to a solution so it sort of feels like I’ve done it myself, and I get some extra info and a wee pep talk to let me know I’m doing ok.
            </p>
          <li><strong>Improving My Process With Reflection</strong></li>
            <p>
                 Reflecting has been helpful because it helps me to remember the parts that I’ve found tricky so I can revisit them easily later.
