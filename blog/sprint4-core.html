    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>  
    <p>
       Neuroplasticity was conceptually proven in a 1968 study that saw the cortical remapping of neurons in monkey brains when nerves to the monkeys hands were cut and ‘rewired’ to the wrong receptors. The neural pathways in the monkey’s brains reconfigured themselves to adjust for the rewiring so that the nerve pathways corresponded to the correct hand touch and movement sensations. The researchers concluded from this that the brain is ‘plastic’ and able to change over time on the fly to account for new information or circumstances. 
       The study on monkeys is a pretty severe case of neuroplasticity as the brain is restructuring a large portion of itself to account for nerve trauma. It is more the smaller cases of plasticity that we are concerned with, however this example illustrate the reconstructive power of the brain.

        On a smaller scale, neuroplasticity is able to reconfigure and strengthen neural pathways through repetitive training and memory exercises. When we learn a new skill we are automatically engaging our brains and stimulating the growth and strengthening of new neural pathways that align with the new skill. This is enforced through disciplined study and training of the new skill to enforce the neural pathway.

        In my own studies I will, and already am, utilise neuroplasticity through revision and dedicated study practices.
