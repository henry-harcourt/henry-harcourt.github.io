    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>  
     <p>
       Neuroplasticity was conceptually proven in a 1968 study that saw the cortical remapping of neurons in monkey brains when nerves to the monkeys hands were cut and ‘rewired’ to the wrong receptors. The neural pathways in the monkey’s brains reconfigured themselves to adjust for the rewiring so that the nerve pathways corresponded to the correct hand touch and movement sensations. The researchers concluded from this that the brain is ‘plastic’ and able to change over time on the fly to account for new information or circumstances. 
       The study on monkeys is a pretty severe case of neuroplasticity as the brain is restructuring a large portion of itself to account for nerve trauma. It is more the smaller cases of plasticity that we are concerned with, however this example illustrate the reconstructive power of the brain.

     <p>
        On a smaller scale, neuroplasticity is able to reconfigure and strengthen neural pathways through repetitive training and memory exercises. When we learn a new skill we are automatically engaging our brains and stimulating the growth and strengthening of new neural pathways that align with the new skill. This is enforced through disciplined study and training of the new skill to enforce the neural pathway.

        In my own studies I will, and already am, utilise neuroplasticity through revision and dedicated study practices.

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
     <p>
        Growth mindset is the belief in oneself that they have a malleable and adaptable mind, capable of learning new concepts and achieving new skills. This is counter to a ‘fixed mindset’ in which the individual is steadfast in their belief that they are unable to learn and struggle with learning new skills or concepts.
        It is valuable to an individual to adopt a growth mindset as the learning potential of the individual is often shown to be accelerated by just the belief in themselves that they can achieve something new. This reinforcing and self-fulfilling prophecy is contrasted with ‘imposter syndrome’, the belief that one is “not smart enough” to achieve something, which can have the same effects as a growth mindset but in the reverse sense that it hinders the individual due to their diminished studiousness and discipline.

     <p>
        I was pleasantly surprised to find that growth mindset is practised commonly in school environments, particularly that of young students who may be struggling with school work. Students are encouraged to practise the growth mindset approach to train themselves into believing in their abilities. It has shown to be an effective method for both already high achieving students as well as, and in particular, struggling students. 
        I found <a href="https://www.innerdrive.co.uk/how-to-develop-a-growth-mindset/">this UK resource</a> describing the usefulness of growth mindset in a school environment helpful as it is directed at teachers and details the way they can encourage their students to engage more deeply in learning.

    <h2>Learning Plan</h2> 
     <p>
        My learning plan is reflected in these concepts as coding is an entirely new field to me. Over the last four weeks of engaging deeply with coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript I have already seen my ability to grow quickly first hand. It is a great feeling knowing that I can adapt and learn, and the idea of growth mindset is further enforced the more I learn and the deeper I go.
