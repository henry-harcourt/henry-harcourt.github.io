          <p>
               Relative, Absolute, and Fixed Positioning all remove desired elements on a web page from the “normal document flow” - this is the default look (flow) of the page that HTML applies to your code, and is what the user sees when they look at your web page.
               The CSS ‘offset properties’ are then used to adjust the positioning on the page.
          </p>
          <p>
               The default ‘position’ of the HTML element is ‘static’. Using these positioning principles may overlap other static elements that are still part of the normal flow, this may require you to do some extra editing and positioning of your elements.
          </p>
          <li><h2>Relative Positioning:</h2></li>
          <p>
               The element is positioned relative to it’s normal (static/default) position. CSS Offset properties will change this positioning. This simply shifts the element on the page relative to where it’s original position was.
          </p>
          <li><h2>Absolute Positioning:</h2></li>
          <p>
               An absolute position will fix an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor. As opposed to being fixed to the position of the viewport (as in ‘fixed positioning’.) If you forget to add a Relative position rule to the parent element then the absolutely positioned element will default to the styling of the body tag.
          </p>
          <li><h2>Fixed Positioning:</h2></li>
          <p>
               Fixed positioned elements are positioned relative to the ‘viewport’ (the device display screen), that is to say the element will stay in place even when the user scrolls the web page - like a pesky advertisement, or perhaps a handy search bar!
               It will not leave a gap in the page where it normally would have been located on the normal document flow, it will just move with you. The home page link on this page for example is set to a 'fixed position', that's my name following you around and possibly interfering with the text on your browser!
