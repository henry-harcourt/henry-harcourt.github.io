        <h1>Reflection on Core Materials</h1>
            <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I learned that my most productive work time is generally in the morning and that I have a practical learning style, a 'hands on' approach is by far the most effective way for me to quickly learn new material. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I learned that I am an INTJ on the Myers Briggs index. This breaks down to Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging. This personality type comes with pros and cons. Pros being: generally attentive to and good at solving problems, a logical and rational mind. Cons being: has an open mind, but can be difficult to sway the INTJ to reconsider established ideas, stubborn.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>    
                        <p>
                            I learned how to plan effectively, by breaking down problems into steps. This applies to both micro coding problems as well as to macro personal goal setting. Being asked what my long and short term career goals were was a useful exercise in taking the time to really consider this and provide a spring board to enact these goals.
                        </p>
                    </li>    
                </ol>
            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    These roles are crucial elements of being a team player and working well with others. Understanding yourself is key to knowing how to engage well with other people or what kind of role you can fill in a soical environment.
                </p>
            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    I was surprised at the depth of the brain's capability to rewire itself - neuroplasticity. After doing some research on the topic I was fascinated to learn about the reconstructive powers of the brain, mostly at the reconstructive abilities that the brain undertakes when severe external trauma is placed on someone, but also at it's ability to strengthen neaural pathways when learning new skills.
                </p>
            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most challenging for me was probably remembering to take the time to do the cultural learnings. I stay very focussed on the technical aspects and then got to the end of the week and realised I still had core material to do. When I did get to the core tasks I found them encouraging, helpful, and enlightening.
                </p>
            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>
                    Dev Academy is trying to produce top quality programmers. To be a top quality programmer you also have to have top quality people skills to be able to work in a team environment or even just engae with people outside of your team or workflow in a pleasant and productive manor. Dev Academy wants the best for their students but they also want their alumni to be representing the school well when they leave. 
                    I respect Dev Academy's endeavour to use it's position as a teaching environment to train people to be good people as well as good programmers. 
                </p>
            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>
                    Not at all. Learning about things such as neuroplasticity, problem solving techniques, and taking the time to evaluate my personal learning style have all proved to be helpful excersises in effectively managing my learning journey to be as productive as possible.
