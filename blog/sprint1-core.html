    <h3>Explain a situation where you had an ethical decision to make</h3>
    <p>Right now no particular situations are springing to mind, however I think my ethical code is reflected all the time in the simple things, such as; standing up on the bus when someone appears to need a seat more than me, picking up my partner from work when it’s raining, sharing things with my flatmates or helping them move furniture on the weekends. Simple stuff for me by comparison to the help it might offer the recipient.</p>

    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>I see particularly how my upbringing in New Zealand culture has affected my values and identity when I am overseas. This was probably most evident to me while I was living in a small ski resort town in Canada amongst a mix of different cultures and nationalities, I realised that I could pretty much pick the other Wellingtonians who were there based on a similar demeanor in conversation and display of social ethics. To me New Zealand culture is about being humble and enjoying the outdoors as well as being grateful for what you have.</p>

    <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
    <p>My strengths can also be my limitations. I have a tendency to over analyse which can be useful in problem solving but a hindrance if I get lost down a rabbit hole of intrigue. 
      My Myers Briggs personality type is INTJ, apparently this is “so me”, the Myers Briggs index describes me as over analytical, hyper rational, hard working, open minded, and confident. </p>

    <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
    <p>Strengths such as determination, willingness to learn, and open mindedness will be my greatest asset on the learning journey. My “strategic mind” should help in breaking down tasks into manageable chunks and methodically working through problems to get to solutions.</p>
    <div class="sprint1-core-content">
    <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at the time, how effective were they?</h3>
    <p>An example that springs to mind is when my flatmates and I were moving into a new flat. We ran into some conflict over the room arrangement (I know right..?) one of the flatmates was a very assertive and somewhat domineering personality who was determined to get it her way. This caused some disagreement and tension and I found myself to be the mediator in the situation. Using rationality and reason I was somewhat able to reign the conversation to a point where it wasn’t an unproductive hurtful argument but where we were actually able to develop a solution</p>
