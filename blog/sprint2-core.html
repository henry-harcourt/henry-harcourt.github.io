   <h1>Boot Camp Learning Plan</h1>

      <h3>Long Term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to find work in a friendly and productive team of developers where I can find some good mentorship and room to grow and improve my skills. My pathway beyond that is quite an open plan, I would like to see how my skills grow and where my strengths lay and build a career pathway based on those. I hope to use the skills I learn at Boot camp to make impactful changes.
          </p>
      <h3>Strengths and Limitatations Predictions</h3>
          <p>
            I think I my limitations will stay the same as predicted earlier, speaking my mind in a group setting will be a limitation that I hope to improve on. My strength will hopefully be in my logical approach to problem solving, hopefully this will see me and others through some tricky spots.
          </p>
      <h3>Non-Technical Skills I Would Like To Develop</h3>
          <p>
            I predict that I will have some trouble at first speaking in front of groups or conveying personal ideas that may be wrong or perceived as stupid. Hopefully I'll get more comfortable and will become comfortable with the people in my cohort - I'm sure I will! 
            Time management could also be a struggle, although I have learned a lot about effective time management over the last five weeks through foundations. I'm sure the workload is going to drastically increase, plus I will have others depending on my contributions. These expectations from others will likely just encourage me to work harder though.
            Also I hear there are some great yoga sessions so i'm looking forward to picking up some skills there!
          </p>
      <h3>My Expectations From the Bootcamp Team</h3>
          <p>
            I understand that Bootcamp is an intense working environment, in terms of workload that is, I also understand that there is great support through the other students, alumni (on slack) and through the facilitators. I think asking fellow students in my cohort will be my go-to method of reaching out for help as this way we can each benefit by strengthening our knowledge together. Failing that I will ask a facilitator. However I seek help I will try to do it in a timely fashion so that I'm not left scrambling last minute and unable to fulfill deadlines.

   <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
      
      <h3>Long Term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My long term goal is to find work in a friendly and productive team of developers where I can find some good mentorship and room to grow and improve my skills. My pathway beyond that is quite an open plan, I would like to see how my skills grow and where my strengths lay and build a career pathway based on those.
          </p>
      <h3>What non-technical skills would I like to develop?</h3>
          <p>
            A non-technical skill I would like to develop is strengthening my team communication skills. I have a bad habit of sometimes assuming people can read my mind.
          </p>
      <h3>A description of my strengths and limitations</h3>
          <p>
            My Strengths: Articulating ideas and plans. Once I have the floor I find that I can articulate an idea or concept quite well, I’ve selected this strength because it goes in contrast to one of my limitations.  
            My Limitations: Keeping my thoughts to myself. Though I can feel as though I might have a good idea or plan, I can fall into the trap of not speaking up early and sharing my thoughts. It would be good to build confidence in speaking my mind.
          </p>
      <h3>Commitment as to how I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>
          I’ll make sure to start my work early and plan out an effective way of breaking down tasks into manageable chunks that allows me time for reflection and review as well as seeking help where I need it and spending extra time on the things that I’m having difficulty with.
          </p>
      <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            Just a helping hand when I need it. Although as I said above I’ll be trying to seek help before the last minute whenever possible so that I’m not being unrealistic in my request. My facilitator has expressed clearly that I can get in touch whenever I need which is most appreciated!
