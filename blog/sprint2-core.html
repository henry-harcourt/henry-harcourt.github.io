   <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
   <h3>Long Term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to find work in a friendly and productive team of developers where I can find some good mentorship and room to grow and improve my skills. My pathway beyond that is quite an open plan, I would like to see how my skills grow and where my strengths lay and build a career pathway based on those.
      </p>
   <h3>What non-technical skills would I like to develop?</h3>
      <p>
        A non-technical skill I would like to develop is strengthening my team communication skills. I have a bad habit of sometimes assuming people can read my mind.
      </p>
   <h3>A description of my strengths and limitations</h3>
      <p>
        My Strengths: Articulating ideas and plans. Once I have the floor I find that I can articulate an idea or concept quite well, I’ve selected this strength because it goes in contrast to one of my limitations.  
        My Limitations: Keeping my thoughts to myself. Though I can feel as though I might have a good idea or plan, I can fall into the trap of not speaking up early and sharing my thoughts. It would be good to build confidence in speaking my mind.
      </p>
   <h3>Commitment as to how I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>
      I’ll make sure to start my work early and plan out an effective way of breaking down tasks into manageable chunks that allows me time for reflection and review as well as seeking help where I need it and spending extra time on the things that I’m having difficulty with.
      </p>
   <h3>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        Just a helping hand when I need it. Although as I said above I’ll be trying to seek help before the last minute whenever possible so that I’m not being unrealistic in my request. My facilitator has expressed clearly that I can get in touch whenever I need which is most appreciated!
